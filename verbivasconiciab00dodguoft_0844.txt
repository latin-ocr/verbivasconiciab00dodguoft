The 1673 Forms of the Baskish Verb which are enlisted above are
‘to be studied by collation with the verses of the New Testament in
Greek, which evoked them from the heads and pens of John Leicarraga
and his valiant colleagues, Landetcheberri, La Rive, Tardets, and
Tartas. Let the statistics be a hait, and a challenge, to the fault-
finders, who are heartily bidden 1 They will help to fix the attention
of the serious reader. He is assumed to know at least English and
French enough to follow the exposition, to wince at mistakes and
illogicalities3 and, if he knows no Baskish, to be willing to learn as
much of it as these Forms carry in their train.

There are in existence nearly thirty copies of the first edition of
Testamenta Berricz, printed by Pierre Hautin‚ at La Rochelle, A. D.
1571. Of these there are four in England, namely in the British
Museum, the Library of the British and Forane Bible Society, the
Bodleian Library, and the Rylands Library at Manchester. The latter
is the finest, as it is also the latest of all to be brought to the notice
of the people called Bascophiles. The Selden ammplam in Oxford is Ι
unluekily incomplete. The unpocketable edition published at the
very end of the 19111 Century, in Strassburg im Elsass, is not in all
details a reprint. Moreover‚ in the preface there are a few misleading
statements3 and it does not explain all the points of interest to be
found in Leicarragas great work. The small editions published in
1903, and 1908, by the Trinitarian Bible Society, in London, contain
some reforms in syntax and orthography, evidently necessary. In this
noble and beautiful version, which holds rank equal to any other first
rendering into any language since the 111110 of Wulfila and Hierome‚
who may have met each other in Constantinople, the religious Basks
will find the Divine Hearts of King J esus and Queen Mary,for Whom
the Apostols and Evangelists wrote the original manuscripts.

If I had any reason to think that my readers would be many, ’
Ι would ask them not to verify every quotation, whether in the
Baskish text or 111 the French of Calvins Nouueau Testa‘noent, printed
in 1566, at Lyon, by Iaques Faure, or Fawe, which the Translators
must have perused most minutely. For, if they did so, they would,
in turning the sacred pagos, very soon wear out those venerable lumps
of paper! Yet Ι would eon them good thank, if they should point
out, on ending the consideration of my argument, any passage which
