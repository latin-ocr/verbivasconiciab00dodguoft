:32 ’ IN TESTAMENTI] BERRIA 617

,ἃ THE FIRST MENTION IN ENGLISH OF THE BASKISH
· NEW TESTAMENT OF 1571.1

ᾖ] Tun Oxford Times of October 20th, 1911, announced the discovery of a thitherto
mrecorded copy of Leicarragas Baskis h New Testament of 1571, which had been
sndded to the Library of the Earl Spencer before 1790. It is surprising that
ῌτ. Ρ. F. William Ryan, in his mos st interesting book on ‘Queen Jeanne of
¹Navarre', published 111 October, 1911, makes no mention of that book, though
··011 p. 33 110 says of her: ‘Heiress to a Crown, she had been taught Greek, Latin,
ν 81101113ος had read the classical masterpieces with famous tutors,' and on pp. 262-

268 alludes to her visiting La Rochelle while that book, dedicated to her, was
passing through the press, and while she was 001103 ponding with Queen Elizabeth
· ὦ England. It occurs to one that she may have learned Greek from Leicarraga
himself? since it 13 01001 that he and his colleagues, or some of them, followed
, the Greek text 30 closely that it would be possible, with a little special research‚
. ho ascertain which edition thereof they had before them during their task. The
’ Bibliographies do not tell us when Leicarragas work was first mentioned in
England, though the Rev. Dr. T. K. Abbott informed me in February, 1905, that
’ 1ιο 11οᾶ found in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, a manuscript of Edward
Lhuyd, Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, which shews that, though he
does not name the author, he had read it, but made a very clumsy use of it. Well,
by chance on April 22 Ι saw in the ‘ Memoirs of Jane of Navarre ⁹, on p. 69 of the
first volume of ‘ Memoirs of Eminently Pious Women ’, by Thomas Gibbons‚ D.D.
(London, 1804), the following passage: ‘About this time the Queen of Navarre,
being zealous to propagate the Protestant religion in Cantabria, a province of the
jurisdiction of Navarre, sent thither pastors who had learned the country language,
which is understood by almost none of the neighbours, and was before believed
incapable of being written. She took care also that the New Testament, the
Catechism, and the Prayers used in the Church of Geneva should be translated
into the Gascoin or Cantabrian tongue‚ which she caused to be printed at Rochel
(eie) in 0 most fine character, and sent to the Cantabriam: Here ‘Gascoin' and
‘ Cantabriam ’ 010 old-fashioned ways of saying ‘Baskish ’‚ the proper name of the
1anguage, the study of which was introduced into England by Sir Thomas Browne,
. ¹ of Pembroke College, in Oxford. It seems that this Life of Jeanne d'Albret was
written not by Τ. Gibbons, who died, according to the Dictionary of National
Biography, in 1785, but by his editor, the Rev. George J erment. It was reprinted
in 1815 and 1820. It is evident that Dr. Jerment took his information from ‘les
'Histoires de de Thou (liv. li.‚ annee 1572) ’, as quoted by M. Julien Vinson, on
p. 29 of his ‘ Bibliographie Basque ⁸.

'I'he words ‘ in a most fine letter ’ correspond to ‘elegantissimis typis* in the
Latin of de Thou. In the copy of Testamenta Ber-ria which is kept in the Bodleian
Library, and which belonged to John Selden, of Hart Hall, Oxford, 0 hand of the
first half of the 17th century has written: ‘De hoc libro loquitur Dominus de
Thou, libro 51 ubi habetur historia anni 1572, in elogio Reginae Nauarrae !’
’ The Rev. J. B. McGovern, of Chorlton·on·Medlock‚ sent at my suggestion a
question to Notes and Queries as to the identity of G. Jerment and 0 reply signed
by R. S. Robson, elder of the Presbyterians in Newcastleupon-'ryne published there

on July 13, informs us that 110 was born at Peebles, studied at the University of

     
       

¹ - ¹ A thousand copies of this note were published as α leaflec by the Trinitarian Bible

’ Society, ofBury Street 7, London, W. C.. on January 11,1913.
² It 13 111010 likely, as the preceding address to his Sovran shews, that hc owed

1101 favour partly to the fact that they both knew Greek. He seems to have been
‘comme inconnu 'to Her Majesty before his imprisonment.
