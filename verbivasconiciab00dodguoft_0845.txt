Though Leicarraga does not mention Dechepare‚ and speaks of his
ι ’ own enterprise as the first use of Baskish, yet it is likely that he
⁶ had read his Remes, published at Bourdeaulx, in 1545. The writings
of these two Presbyters stand in the same relation to later Baskish
Literature as the Homeric Epics to all subsequent books in the Grecian
DialectS. Therefore, to master them is the best method of preparing
the intellect for a thoroughly honest criticism, and overstanding, of
the living, but decadent, Heuscara of this 20th Century. Dec-hren yw
hanner y ywaz'th3 and, when the Gauls named Thusz's thus, is it
wrong to guess that it was because they knew the importance of that
high-born Gave, as being to them then the only practicable beginning
of a good road to guide them to the pools and swamps of the Bataui
and Belyae, who boated at its northern mouth? The urbewokner of
the Alps seem to have known the Baskish word for mter. The thne
and the Rhone run down from clear, clean snow, like the Nive of
Baskland. But, when they meet the sea, their waves are dirty!
My Sympsis can not be carried so easily as the French-English δε
English-French Wordbook of John Bellows. Howbeit, the Scholar
puts his book, not into his pocket, but into his head. ‘Dysy yn yrslff
a welyehl‘ And 10 learn these F orms by heart is light exercise.

’ They are indeed not more difficult to remember than the names of the

parishes along the sea—coast of Wales and England, and the border of
Scotland: as the foes of Great Britain do. They cling, linking on
each to each, as sweet peas do by their tendrils. And, if we keep
their frontier well, the rest of the great garden of the Heuskarian
Verb will quickly join and make a lovely bouquet for the minds nose
and eyes! For those who are not born Basks‚ it is not only useless,
but also impossible, to memorise its vast, unwieldly Pctradz'yme. Nor
can these be printed upon sheets small enough, and yet stout enough,
for mobilisation. It would require a whole kinematographic establish-
ment to bring them before the eyes of a class in any apprehensible
scheme. ' For that reason a topothetical method of study, not of isolated
words, but of authorised phrases from a known source, from the legiti-
mate prose of a genuine master of his mother-tung‚ is recommended,
as the fruit of my experience since 1886. Not to stop, but to stimulate
enquiry and research, is the sole object, the whole aim, of this labour
of love3 not ‘danyos llwybr i yyfiwwydcl’, but to rebuke those who,
knowing it, seek to hide the way to perfection in a language which
desei-ves to be perpetuated, and to be contrasted with all others which
have been spoken in any part of our quaky little planet. How-ever,
‘no living man all things can '‚ since lise is but a short spell of time.
