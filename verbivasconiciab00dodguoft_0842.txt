6530 NOTANDA IN TESTAMENTU BERRIA

extinct‚ like the Dodo) for August, 1912, by an incompetent scribe, who had
discovered that St Lukes Gospel ‘ has a religious flavour ⁹, while hc evidently 1188 ’

n0t; and saw a resemblance between ‘Saxon ‘ and ⁴ Isaac's son '! 1f 118 had
honest-ly signed his name, as good manners require, his nonsense‚ bad tacte, and
ignorance, would be better worth a scientific hiding and detailed derision. Name-
less writings are generally left unnamed. Even if their contents are not lieful‚
they are less useful to students than those which bear the stamp of good saith and
good will. If they do any good, why should the world be deprived of the mean of
thanking the author ‘?

L'Abbe Daranatz, Chanoine honoraire, Secretaire de l'Eveche, Aumonier des
Filles dela Croix, remercie vivement l'infatigable M. Dodgson de l’envoi de son,
livre ‘The Baskish Verb' (1912), de la citation aimable de la page 183, et le
felicite de sa belle ardeur dans le champ un peu aride des 788 formes diverses du
Verbe de Licarrague dans l'Evangile de St Luc. 29 ι111111 1912.

The ornament 011 the title-page was taken from an edition of the Nouum
Testamentum of the Roman Church‚ printed in Lyon, in 1578. No doubt even in
the days of St James, whom Spaniards believe to have evangelized their ances-
1018, the words of the language now called Vasconense had begun to fly away, or
practise avitation, like the birds in that woodcut! Monsieur F. Courboin‚ of the
Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, sent me this note about it ε ‘ Les initiales Ι. F. sont
celles d'un graveur qui a execute‚ notamment d‘apres Hans Holbein, d'excellentes
vignettes que l'on voit dans des editions de Bale et de Lyon, mais on ne sait pas
encore a quel nom correspond cette abbreviation. L'oeuvre du ‘⁴ Maitre I. F.’' est
etudie dans le “Peintre-Graveur” de Passavant 81, dans le “Monogrammiste de
Nagler”.'

The Readers of the Clarendon Press alone assisted me in the preparation of
this book, of which the first sheet was sent out on August 25, 1914; the last on J uly
30, 1915. To them many thanks are due. They are not responsible, if 011 ety-
mologica] grounds I write‘ plural ’, 111 French, rather than the pedantic, dialectal
‘pluriel’‚ which has no parallel in the plurality of the Italian, Provencal, and Spanish
dialects3 and (tt-il, in stead of a-t-il, which wastes the labour of compositors, and
has no more raison ‹vett-e than vien-il, or a-til. If vient comes from Latin uenit, is
not at a shortened form of ha(be)t ‘? Let those reply who have studied the trans-
formation of Gaulish Latin into the language of Calvin, Montaigne, and Rabelais.

My proofing would no doubt have been better done, if my heart had not been .
very deeply grieved, and my head most sorely distracted‚ by the sorrowy noisiness
of a sinny war. Requiescat in pala-e! Amen.l The admirers of Leicarragas Trans· .
1811011 will thank Sir John Rhys, for having obtained from a private source the cost
of the printing. Ι had not been able to persuade the Delegates of the Clarendon

Press, or any firm of publishers, to undertake it at their own risk. Posterity and
Forane Nations will read this with surprise.

¹ ‘Many congratulations on the good news that your book is finished, & best
wishes for its success. Perhaps, as you say, the moment is not favourable for
attracting= public attention ; but then, I suppose, it 18 1101, for the moment, but

for all 111118. Ε. M. Tenison, 28 July, 1915.' Ι 8111 indebted to this lady for the
mention of Mr. Geralds book on p. 545.
