616 NOTANDA

appear to have possessed before 1571 no Baskish book to read except those
very Rimes aforesaid. Bishop Christopher VVordsworffi, in his valuable
edition of the New Testament in Greek, says of Hebrews xii. 13, 14, 15:
‘ Thus καὶ τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιήσατε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν form an Hexameter verse,
and οὗ χωρὶς οὐδεὶς ὄψεται τὸν Κύριον· ἐπισκοποῦντες μή τις ὖστερῶν ἀπὸ make
two Iambic verses. Cf. John iv. 35 3 James i. 17 ; 2 Peter ii. 22.’ These
last instances are indeed also bits of στίχος πολιτικόςὶ Other cases of metre
in the Greek Testament are proofs of the learning of St. Paul, viz. (a) Titos
i. 12, Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί. which, as Sb- Hie-rome
and St. Chrysostom say, is a quotation from Epimenides and Kallimachos.
(b) Philippians iv. 4: Χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ πάντοτε· πάλιν ε’ρῶ, χαίρετε. This,
which seems to be a fragment of an hymn, is followed by words which
would be a good Decheparian verse, if they were written γνωσθήτω πᾶσιν
ἀνθρώποις ΙΙ τὸ ἐπιεικὲς ὑμῶν. Modestia uestra nota Sit Η munibus hominibus .·
the Latin equivalent, would also pass in the same rank as, ‘Let your
seemly moderatiori Η unto all men be made known 1⁵ An other verse in
the same dansy mette, and making a rime too, occurs in the Greek Testa·
ment, in the Apocalypse xxii. 13, whether we read ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ τὸ τέλος, ὁ
πρῶτος καὶὸ ἔσχατος, 01· ὅ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος, ἡ ἀρχὴ καὶ τὸ τέλος. Even
John Galvin made at least two in the French New Testament (translated
from the original Greek) which it is clear that Leicarraga collated very
carefully, and which he surpassed very distinctly in accuracy, upon the
whole, when he wrote in Romans ix. 5. . . . ‚ ‘ qui est Dieu sur toutes
choses, benit eternellement ’ ; in Revelation xxi. 6, ‘J e suis alpha et omeya,
le commencement et la fin '. It is well known that there are metrical
pieces in the Anglican Bible of 1611, as ⁴ Husbands, love your wives, and
be not bitter'against them Ξ ’ One finds them even in the revised version
of the Apocrypha. “

The best edition οξ Dechepares book is that of Herr V. L. A. Stempf,
of the Grand Duchy of Baden, who in 1870 became a Frenchman and
a wine-merchant in BordeauX, where he published it in 1893, and died on
February 22, 1909. Some of Dechepares verses are metrically lame, and
can be pronounced only elisionally. The following verse from p. 52 serves
as a specimen of his rhythm ε ‘ Ez etare hitz orotan Η fida ere gizona ' ; i. e.
‘Nor either even trust the manilin (each and) every word!' With this
compare two new-laid Decheparian lines: (a) ‘Ethen‚ erre, fini dute ΙΙ thinian
den fedea ! ' It renders : ‘ The faith which at the summit 1 is: they have
ended, burnt, torn up !’, and is an anagram of ‘ The year nineteen hundred
and fifteen ³, when Christian Belgium exclaims, ⁶ Consummatum est Ξ ’
(b) ‘God come! pace sai all, Ι hope! All aids g0‚ peace come, I hope!’

This is a double rearrangement of the letters which spell the names and
title of Giacomo della chiesa, Pope!

BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS.
