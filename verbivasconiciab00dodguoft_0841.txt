lhave had the great honour & pleasure of seeing this book in MS„ and Ι trust
that Mr. Dodgson will be able to have the whole in complete form published, so

, that the whole world may take a delight in viewing his truly immense & erudite

labours, labours which in my humble opinion should meet withan immense
success. To my friend Mr Dodgson 1 R. Wortley Dodd, 28 Νον., 1906.

Ι have looked through the work of Mr Ε. S. Dodgson‚ δε greatly admire the
persevering labour which he has bestowed upon it, labour which so few bestow on
any work, but labour which is all the more valuable. Ι sincerely hope that he
will succeed in getting it published. E. W. Bullinger, D.D. 3 Dec., 1906.
