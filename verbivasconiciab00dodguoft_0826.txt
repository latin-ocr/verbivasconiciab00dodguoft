604 NOTAN DA

everywhere evident, of Leiqarragas rendering of the Greek. To be impartial,
Ι 113νο noted a few places where Calvins translation is the more exact of the two.
It would be a boon to scholare, if some patron of research would publish the two
versions by the side of an intervening column presenting the Greek as printed in
France in the seventh decade of the 16ῑ11 Century. It is possible that Leicarraga
may have worked eclectically upon a collation of two or three variant editions of
the original text. My interlinear notes raise that question here and there. I hope
to publish, as a complementary companion to this volume, a Synopsis combining
all the other parts of Testamenta Rem-ia. But before that a non-quotational, but
analytical, Index to the whole of Leicarragas Verb, including his dedications to
the Queen and to the Basks, and his other documents, translated not from the
Greek, but from the French of the Sect of Geneva, shall be attempted.

I possess the following letter concerning my projected Synopsis, written by the
author of ‘Le Verba Easque, . . . ouvrage publie par le Prince L. L. Bonaparte.
(Paris, Benjamin Duprat, 1858.)’. Some of his replies tomy questions about
Leicarragas Verb are incorporated in the preceding pageS. 1 had asked him to
compose such a work himself. Ευέεἶιέ de Bayonne. Bayonna le 15 fe'm’ier 1889.

Ι began my own synopsis 111 the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris 111 the autumn
of 1889, and have at intervals published some very imperfect specimens of it.
Some of these are rehandled in this volume, blended with others never·printed
before, and the whole⁷ embracing about half the New Testament‚ is offered to
Comparative PhilologistS. They will be the first to recognize that such a task was
worth undertaking, at however great a sacrifice of time, inking, and thinking,
even if they regret that no worthier workman has produced a more satisfactory
study of the problem. ‘ Books are written to be read by those who can understand
them ’: as Sir Walter Raleigh, of Oxford, has told us.

TO THE BASKS.

¹The words in Baskish, as they are
written, thus are they also pronounced‚
after the likeness of Latin, with all
letters: and u vowel fully, as if it were
ou. Moreover in this Baskish transla-
tion of the New Testament some single
words have been put amid the text in
minuter letter, that it may be recognised
that these, for (all) their being words
which arc understood in the text, yet
ure not belonging to the very body of
the text, but set down as declaratory.
