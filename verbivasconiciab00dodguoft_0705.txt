¹ The Moon may originally have been hila, illa = mot-tuum (lumen), considered
· ae the dead (luminat-y), in eontrast to the sun as a sels-lighted‚ heating, always
. full-faced body. Primitive men would notice the growth and dwindling of its
illuminated disc, rather than its 1116131116 (1631111633 and sterility. Later on they
· would observe the recurrence of its mensuality, its aid 111 the arithmetic of the
time-table; and, just as νηῦηα 631116 10 1116311 moueth, „mons-time, 33 3 measure for
the Calendar in English, so this hila was used for μήν, mensis, in old Baskish. In
St Luke 1. 36. Leiearraga wrote hil = mouth, followed not by the definite article ;
but by haur = this. Yet in 16 other places, namely St Luke 1. 24, 26, 56. ; Acts

11. 2.; 13. 5. ; 22. 2.; we find the common, modern, compound name hz'Ie-bethe =
mouth-full, full-month. In the Spanish Dialeets this is he'lla, or illa-betha The
' usual word for moon, σελήνη, lana, occurs nine times in this translation; viz. 111
· Matt. 24. 29.; Mark¹ 13. 24.; Luke 21. 25.; Α613 2. 20. 3 1 C. 15. 41. ; Apoc. 6. 12.;

‘lighted, bright corpse', nor ‘dead light'3 but ‘ mcuth-(malcinyyliyht'‚ ‘month-

as under Cen Ap. 1. 16„ and a 1101111 substantive meaning lucc, liyht; and 6011163
perhaps from har, ar= stone as a producet of fire, 3 reflector of Iiyht. The
Southern Basks, in the Highlands of Soule and Roneal, call the moon qaiko =

, ἰεαεροπ. Μ. Η. Α. Junod wrote on p. 284 of Vol. 2 of “The Life of a South African
Tribe ’ (NeuehateL Switzerland‚ 1913) : ‘ When, at last, it dis-appears, it is munyama,
the obscurity; the moon is said to fa, to have died. Is this meant figuratively‚ as
⁴, is often the case with the word ku-fh, or do the Thonga really think that each
'U moon dies and is replaced by a new moon‘? It is difficult to say ; most of them
believe 111 3 real destruction, and 3 new creation of the moon each mouth
(Timotheo), and this would explain why they have the same word sor moon and
month; they evidently identify the two notions. However some told me they
’ῥ’ believed itwas the 331116 celesti-al body which appeared anew each month.’
