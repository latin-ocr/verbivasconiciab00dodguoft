METRICAL VERSES IN LEIQARRAGAS BASKISH
NEW TESTAMENT. A.D. 1571.1

THE longest portion of my Key or Guide to the Forms of the Verb used
in the Baskish New Testament (Testamenta Berria), made from the original
Greek by Ioannes Leicarraga and four other Bask Catholic Presbyters who
became Calvinist Ministers‚ and published at La Rochelle in the year 1571,
is, ΒΜ, to be published in the summer of 1915.

During the proofing of its sheets I have observed a fact which has not
been mentioned by the other writers who have in some measure investigated
that beautiful work, the oldest monument which we possess in prose of the
Baskish language, or, as Leigtarraga‚ and his only predecessor in its litera·
ture, Bernard Dechepare, called it, Heuscara. The Rimes of this author,
also a Bask Presbyter, older than Leicarraga, but his contemporary, were
published at BordeauX‚ in 1545. Only one exemplar of this most precious
book exists. It is kept in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, and ought
to be reproduced in facsimile, without delay. In the Revue de Linquistique
for 1893, pp. 275—277, there is an article in which Ι identify its measure
with the στίχος πολιτικός of the Mediaeval Byzantine Epic Poem on the
exploits of Digenis Akritas, which ought to be done into English. This
metre was also used here and there by the ancient Attio Dramatists‚ e. g.,
ὄλβον, ὃν Δαρεῖος ἦρεν οὐκ ἄνευ θεῶν τινός, in line 164 Of ‘che Persai Of Aisehylos.²

Its technical name came from its being in favour at the Court of Con-
stantinopolis, so that it may be rendered ‘The town measure ⁹. It consists
of 8 feet and a caesura, followed by seven3 and as specimens of its effect

one may quote from the English of the old Christian Hymn Te Deum
Laudamus the following :—

We believe that Thou shalt come to Η be our Judge : we therefore pray
Thee help Thy servants whom Thou hast ΙΙ with Thy precious Blood redeem'd !

Or, as a modern instance, these lines :—

Come and see me, if you happen Η to be passing through the town:

Try to think, since last you met me, Η how much precious time is flown!
Yon would surely recognize me, ΙΙ tho' I'm wearing cap and gown :

lt is painful to be living Η where to no man Ι am known!

¹ A thousand copies of this note were published as a leaflet, on May 17, 1915,
the Birthday of the King of the Spains, by the Trinitarian Bible Society.

² ‘I could not admit that there is any similarity between the στίχος πολιτικός and
the lino from the Persae. The former is an imnbic tetrameter catalectic (scanned by

{tepent irid‘izter times), thc latter a trochaic- tetrameter catalectic. S. Gaselee, M.A.'
